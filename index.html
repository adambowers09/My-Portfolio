            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                Welcome!  My name is Adam Bowers and I am an aspiring Software Developer/Coder from Greenville, North Carolina.  Currently I am enrolled in the UNC Chapel Hill Virtual Bootcamp looking to start a new career in a high-growth profession. Right now, I work for U.S. Cellular as a Business Account Support Specialist however, I want to take my career in a new direction doing something I enjoy and am passionate about.      
            </p>

            <p>
                I grew up in a small town just outside of London, England and moved to the United States with my family as a teenager.  I attended a Community College post High School and recieved my Associates Degree and started my career with U.S. Cellular.  When the pandemic hit I have begun working from home which allows me to maximize my free time better than when I was commuting to and from work everyday which is another reason why I decided to take this deep dive into becoming a developer.  
            </p>
            
            <br>
    
            <p>  
                When i'm not working I enjoy watching and playing all sports and spending time with my girlfiend and our two pets.  As long as I can remember technology has always been something that has attracted me but I never thought I could have a career in it until now.
